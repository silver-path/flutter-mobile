Honest work, good company, and a regular routine are all they need. Of all the Kithain they are known for their honesty and integrity. It is said they are as honest as the dirt under their fingernails.",
        overview: """There’s a little bit of boggan in everyone.
Everyone likes to learn a secret, or to tell one; even the freest of spirits needs a place to return to between one journey and the next. Boggans thrive in these spaces, in the comfort of home, and the bonds between friends. Dreams of an honest day’s work and a cozy living provided by it, this kith has long enjoyed helping those who appreciate their efforts. Whether finishing a craftsman’s work at the end of a long day, completing the chores of a busy housekeeper, or bringing together unlikely friendships and romances, tales of mysterious folk helping others are the heart and soul of boggan history.

While not exactly shy, boggans work best just out of notice. Tracing their history often involves looking just behind or to the side of the spotlight, but with a sufficiently practiced eye, picking out the patterns of a boggan’s helping hand is easy. Humble creatures, they often prefer to highlight the efforts of others. They might not speak directly of their influence, but they are always eager to tell the story, and usually have it firsthand. Even if they aren’t the main character of the story, there’s usually a boggan in the room where it happened.""",
